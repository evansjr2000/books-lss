\myitem{Chapter 1: There's Three Kinds of Industries}
\myitem{Chapter 2: Understanding Earlier Production Systems}

\mysubitem{S:} Craft, Mass Production, and Lean.
\mysubitem{Q:} What is the difference between Lean and Mass Production, and Lean and Craft?
Mass production is concerned with efficiency, primarily through large-scale production, and full-loading.
Lean has to do with the true purpose of a business, which is producing a product that satisfies the customer (provides
value), achieves the companies goals, and makes a profit.

Mass production is craft on steroids, so its focus is also not the customer.
And lean is mass production with customer value first. ``Do it right the first time.''

\myitem{Chapter 3: Lean Production---Five Principles}

\mysubitem{S:} The five principles are Value, Value streams, Flow, Pull, and Perfection.

\mysubitem{Q:} Define the five terms and how they relate to software development, and information assurance.
