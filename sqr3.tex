\mysubitem{S:} Craft, Mass Production, and Lean.
\mysubitem{Q:} What is the difference between Lean and Mass Production, and Lean and Craft?
Mass production is concerned with efficiency, primarily through large-scale production, and full-loading.
Lean has to do with the true purpose of a business, which is producing a product that satisfies the customer (provides
value), achieves the companies goals, and makes a profit.

Mass production is craft on steroids, so its focus is also not the customer.
And lean is mass production with value first. ``Do it right the first time.''
